>## About Project 7
Project 7 was an attempt to improve upon our professor's pricing model for home sales by analyzing the correlation of several independent x-variables to housing prices over time. Please see the files below.

<a class="anchor" id="project-7-tools"></a>
>## Project 7 Tools
Project 7 used several Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, sklearn and matplotlib. I also worked with Jupyter Notebook, csv files and excel to 'clean' the raw data (impute and/or drop data, as necessary) and created dataframes, histograms, and scatter graphs to vizualize the information.

<a class="anchor" id="about-project-8"></a>
>## About Project 8
Project 8 analyzed the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS data) to identify sales trends and correlation among industry categories over time. The project included setting up an SQL server in Docker and connecting it to VS Code using Python's pyodbc library. I also identified correlation among sales for New Car Dealers, Gasoline Stations and Fuel Dealers - and then created a heatmap of this correlation using Pearson's Correlation Coefficent and Python's seaborn library. Please see the files below.

>## Project 8 Tools
Project 8 used several Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and seaborn. I also worked with Docker, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook and MySQL to carry out the goals listed above.
